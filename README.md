## NLP_With_Disaster_Tweets :
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.   
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).  

**I have predicted whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict as 1. If not, predict as 0.**

## Translator_&_spell_checker :
### Translator
* I have translated each word or sentence in a dateset  from English to Spanish, French and German.  
* Note: I have only worked with 1000 rows due to huge compile time (It has nearly 1.7 lakh rows)  
### Spell Checker
* Created a program that automatically correct that spelling from the word or a given sentence in a dataset.
